= Project: ESP32 DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring (Arduino IoT Cloud)

This is an IoT project using ESP32 and DHT22 to monitor real-time temperature and humidity. The data is visualized on the Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard.

== Step 1: Installation

1. Go to https://create.arduino.cc/ and sign in to your account
2. Navigate to Arduino IoT Cloud (https://create.arduino.cc/iot)
3. Create a new Thing and add two variables:
   - `temperature` (float, Read Only, from device)
   - `humidity` (float, Read Only, from device)
4. Set up your device (ESP32) and link it to the Thing
5. Install the required libraries:
   - `DHT sensor library`
   - `Arduino_ConnectionHandler`
   - `ThingProperties.h` will be auto-generated
6. Copy the provided code or customize it as needed
7. Click "Upload Sketch" to flash your ESP32

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit following the layout shown in `layout.png`.

**Wiring**:
- DHT22 VCC → 3.3V ESP32  
- DHT22 GND → GND ESP32  
- DHT22 Data → GPIO 4 (G4)  
- Tambahkan resistor 10kΩ antara pin Data dan VCC

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the sketch via Arduino IoT Cloud interface using the “Upload Sketch” button. The code includes IoT Cloud connection, reading from DHT22, and updating cloud variables.
